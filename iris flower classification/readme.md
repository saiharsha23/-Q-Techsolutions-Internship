# Iris flower classification 

## Description 
This project is used to classify the flowers into setosa,verginica, and versilia  based on the features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width.This model uses the load_iris() dataset which is imported from sklearn library  consists of flower features and classifies the flowers using decision trees and random forest models and save the results.Visualizations help in comparing the accuracy and effectiveness of the models.

## File structure
**data/**:It has the dataset named iris_dataset.csv
**models/**:It contains the decision tree and random forest models.
**outputs/**:It has the outputs that are classified("predictions.csv) by training the decision tree and random forest models and it has the evaluation_metrices. 
**price_prediction.py/**:It has the main source code for training the models and predicting the output
